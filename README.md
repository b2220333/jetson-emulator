# jetson-emulator
The Jetson Emulator emulates the NVIDIA Jetson AI-Computer's Inference and Utilities API for image classification, object detection and image segmentation (i.e. imageNet, detectNet and segNet). The intended users are makers, learners, developers and students who are curious about AI computers and AI edge-computing but are not ready or able to invest in an actual device such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit (https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit). E.g. this allows every student in a computer class to have their own personal AI computer to explore and experiment with. This Jetson Emulator presents a pre-configured, ready-to-run kit with 2 virtual HDMI displays and 4 virtual live-cameras. This enables usage familiarisation with the Jetson API and experimentation with AI computer vision inference. It is a great way to quickly and easily get 'hands-on' with Jetson and experience the power of AI.
